General Notes so I can remember what I'm doing.


I've created a new branch for two reasons.

1) I shouldn't be working directly in the master, and I'm hitting a point in complexity where I need
to start breaking out the code into a new branch so if/when I break it, I have fall-back points that
are not tied to the Master branch.

2) I'm going to make some major changes to the structure and work on getting some complex data structures
in place using Flask's SQLAlchemy library.

So whats the plan?

Since this is suppose to mimic some kind of web store, we're going to work on structuring our data like so:

Planned Data Models:

User - basic user account
UserType - account types, customer, admin, customer_service, etc
UserAccessControl - used for admin access control
Product - a product
ProductCategory - organizational categories for products
Order - a completed order by the customer, tracking stuff on it
Cart - what the customer has selected to buy
Ratings - custer ratings, super simple table, rating from 1-5 or something like that
Reviews - customer reviews
Ticket - Customer service ticketing system
TicketMessage - messages related to a specific ticket
Images - represents an image in our static/images directory


Planned Data Routes:

/user/login                         - login
/user/logout                        - logout
/user/account                       - view/edit account information
/user/register                      - register a new account
/user/close                         - delete an account
/user/reset_password                - form to let a user reset their password
/product                            - list products
/product?page=X                     - product listing page #
/product?c=X                        - product listing specific category (can be used with page)
/product/[product_id]               - list specific product
/cart                               - view the cart
/checkout                           - this will need multiple steps, I'll need to research best practic with this
/product/[id]/review                - view reviews
/product/[id]/rating                - view ratings, actual ratings, not just a summary rating
/product/[id]/customer/review       - write a product review
/product/[id]/customer/rate         - set a rating for a product
/cs                                 - submit a customer service ticket
/cs/[id]                            - view a tickets status, have means to add message built in
### Administrative functionality, all these need UAC wrapping ###
/admin/user                         - view all users, only admin/CS, option for all
/admin/user/new                     - create a new user, defaults to admin/CS users only
/admin/user/[id]/ban                - place a ban on a specific user
/admin/user/[id]/uac                - set Access control rules for a user, only admin/CS
/admin/product                      - admin view of products
/admin/product/new                  - add a new product
/admin/product/[id]                 - update/view specific product
/admin/product/[id]/review          - edit/remove/approve reviews
/admin/product/[id]/rating          - view rating, can completely reset, but not modify ratings
/admin/cs/ticket                    - view Customer service tickets
/admin/cs/ticket/[id]               - work a specific ticket
/admin/cs/order                     - view orders
/admin/cs/order/[id]                - view/work a specific order
