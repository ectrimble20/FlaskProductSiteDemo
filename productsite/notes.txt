General Notes so I can remember what I'm doing.


I've created a new branch for two reasons.

1) I shouldn't be working directly in the master, and I'm hitting a point in complexity where I need
to start breaking out the code into a new branch so if/when I break it, I have fall-back points that
are not tied to the Master branch.

2) I'm going to make some major changes to the structure and work on getting some complex data structures
in place using Flask's SQLAlchemy library.

So whats the plan?

Since this is suppose to mimic some kind of web store, we're going to work on structuring our data like so:

Planned Data Models:

User - basic user account
UserType - account types, customer, admin, customer_service, etc
UserAccessControl - used for admin access control
Product - a product
ProductCategory - organizational categories for products
Order - a completed order by the customer, tracking stuff on it
Cart - what the customer has selected to buy
Ratings - custer ratings, super simple table, rating from 1-5 or something like that
Reviews - customer reviews
Ticket - Customer service ticketing system
TicketMessage - messages related to a specific ticket
Images - represents an image in our static/images directory


Planned Data Routes:

/user/login                         - login
/user/logout                        - logout
/user/account                       - view/edit account information
/user/register                      - register a new account
/user/close                         - delete an account
/user/reset_password                - form to let a user reset their password
/product                            - list products
/product?page=X                     - product listing page #
/product?c=X                        - product listing specific category (can be used with page)
/product/[product_id]               - list specific product
/cart                               - view the cart
/checkout                           - this will need multiple steps, I'll need to research best practic with this
/product/[id]/review                - view reviews
/product/[id]/rating                - view ratings, actual ratings, not just a summary rating
/product/[id]/customer/review       - write a product review
/product/[id]/customer/rate         - set a rating for a product
/cs                                 - submit a customer service ticket
/cs/[id]                            - view a tickets status, have means to add message built in
### Administrative functionality, all these need UAC wrapping ###
/admin/user                         - view all users, only admin/CS, option for all
/admin/user/new                     - create a new user, defaults to admin/CS users only
/admin/user/[id]/ban                - place a ban on a specific user
/admin/user/[id]/uac                - set Access control rules for a user, only admin/CS
/admin/product                      - admin view of products
/admin/product/new                  - add a new product
/admin/product/[id]                 - update/view specific product
/admin/product/[id]/review          - edit/remove/approve reviews
/admin/product/[id]/rating          - view rating, can completely reset, but not modify ratings
/admin/cs/ticket                    - view Customer service tickets
/admin/cs/ticket/[id]               - work a specific ticket
/admin/cs/order                     - view orders
/admin/cs/order/[id]                - view/work a specific order



Next order of business.

Revision 1's last changes implemented and added in some new POC elements, just things I wanted to hash out before I did
more major changes to the system.

The next changes to the branch will be the route changes and implementations.  I'll be building all paths prior to the
implementation phase similar to how I built all the models prior to building the data sets.

Right now, I'm thinking the CS and checkout routes will be part of the index routes, the cart route will be part of the
products routes.  Admin will be it's own element, I'm not sure if I should consider it a domain object considering that
it will not have a real representation, only being an administrative functionality. which will need only templates,
routes and forms.

Okay, so for some new functionality that I've found I need in order to manage things, we need to look at the user
structure again.

I think having a model specifically for "UserType" isn't helpful.  I think we can accomplish what that model would
handle by simply having 2 flags on the user table.  1 flag for "admin" and another for "customer_service", so if a
user is an administrator, they have the admin flag, if they can only perform CS functions, they have the
customer_service flag.

This should simply things a bit.

I think the UAC needs some work as well, it will serve as a "what can an admin/CS user do" function.  The way it's
currently implemented (though not in the code) is that a user will have an allowed "route" assigned to it, this route
is then checked against a user's ID with a "SELECT WHERE ID AND ROUTE ==" query.  What I'd like to do, is to make
the routes DB tables, so it's an ID check, not a string check.  This will also allow me to simplify the assignment
of UAC routes to a user.

We can then use a relational table to assign route ID + user ID

This will require me to rebuild the user DB table, but I think it'll make things easier to implement in the future.

I've made good progress with the above table rebuilds.  So far I have a working access control, I also have working user
and product administration.  Though I need removal, ban and a few of the minor features to add in.

I also need to implement admin checks into the main menu, but that's not a big deal.  I also have a few other tweaks to
make regarding formatting and what not but again, this is just a demo product for coding purposes, not a real product
so it really doesn't matter if it looks terrible.
