# FlaskProductSiteDemo

Taking from what I've learned of Flask I'm making a store front application.

At this time, it's not really in a working state, but some things do work, and I've branched it off for a larger revision.

The end goal is to have site that can do the following:
1) List/Search/Shop, customer interaction to add items to their cart, place an order, etc
2) Customer Service - allow specified users to manage orders, customer service tickets, review the reviews etc.
3) Flushed out products, allow category assignment, allow reviews and ratings, stock tracking etc.
4) Administrative portal.  Allow administrative actions on users, products, reviews, etc

This isn't going to be a commercially viable product, this is really just a showcase of what I can do with Flask.

Note:  I do not plan to put a proper JS powered frontend on this.  I do plan to do a Flask microservice powered version
of this at some point which will use VueJS or React as a front end.  I'm a pretty terrible UI designer, I can code them
fine and can handle CSS but I have the UI design skills of a 3 year old.
